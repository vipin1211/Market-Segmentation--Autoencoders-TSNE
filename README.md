# Market-Segmentation--Autoencoders+TSNE

• Marketing is crucial for the growth and sustainability of retail business.

• Marketers can help build the company’s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales.

• One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs.

• By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs.

I have used Autoencoders to find the optimal number of clusters before applying K means.
The results were visualized using PCA and TSNE to compare the results obtained.
